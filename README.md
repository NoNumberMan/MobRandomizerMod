# Mob Randomizer

allows you to map mobs to random other mobs. So, if normally a zombie would spawn, now a blaze may spawn.

**How does it work?**

When you start the game, a random map will be created that maps every eligible mob in the game to another mob. When you then play the game, a spawned zombie will always be converted into the mapped other mob. This may be a skeleton, a blaze, a pig, etc.

<br />

**Which mobs are randomized?**

Every mob in the game is randomized, except for the wither boss, the ender dragon, and the unused mobs such as the giant.

<br />

**What can mobs randomize to?**

By default, every eligible mob, except for blazes and endermen, can be randomized to any other eligible mob. Blazes and endermen can be randomized to most mobs, except for silverfish, endermites, shulkers, wandering traders, skeleton horses, trader llamas, vexes, evokers, vindicators, and elder guardians. This is to make sure that blaze rods and ender pearls can still be obtained in a reasonable way.

<br />

**Can I change what mobs can randomize into?**

Yes! This mod is very customizable through the config file. This file can be found as: (by default) %appdata%->.minecraft/config/mob_randomizer.json. After running the mod once, the default config will be generated for the blaze and enderman. You can use this is a template for any additional restrictions. You can of course also opt to remove the default restrictions.

<br />

**What's next?**

I'm still working on randomizing entities that are spawned together with structures, such as piglin brutes.
Another planned feature is to allow a randomization to be saved per world, such that you can run multiple worlds, each with its own randomization map. This would also allow you to reload the game without creating a new randomization.
